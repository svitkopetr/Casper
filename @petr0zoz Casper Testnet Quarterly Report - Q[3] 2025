I haven’t made any hardware or configuration changes, nor any software updates except when required by the Casper team.

I’m using a regular AX41 server provided by Hetzner, and I’m completely satisfied with it.

I can say it’s a great program to challenge yourself and gain hands-on experience. It can be challenging at times, but there’s always enough time to fix any issues that come up.
The guides provided by the team are always useful, and I really like the way they communicate with testnet members.
I hope that in the next quarters, more projects will be deployed on the testnet so I’ll have a chance to interact with them.
